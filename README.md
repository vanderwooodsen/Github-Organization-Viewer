The project is deployed to https://christis.page/Github-Organization-Viewer/

To run it locally simply run:

```
npm install
npm run start
```

Note that Github limits unauthenticated api calls to 60 per hour per IP. I added a box to set your Github API Token if needed to bypass this limit.

Tech used: React, Redux, Tailwind
